<h1>Sector F Labs: Thoughtful Software for a Human Future</h1>
<p>
    Sector F Labs is a personal workshop dedicated to building purposeful,
    privacy-first software. Our approach is inspired by the spirit and outcomes
    of Bell Labs—where open, creative collaboration shaped not just technology,
    but the very philosophy of how to build it.
</p>
<p>
    We believe in creating tools that adapt to you, prioritizing simplicity,
    thoughtful engineering, and user-respectful design. Our work is guided by
    the conviction that the best software emerges from environments that foster
    curiosity, autonomy, and a relentless pursuit of clarity.

<h2>Engineering with Intention</h2>
<p>
    We believe the best tools quietly do their job. Every design decision should
    serve a clear purpose: focused systems that do one thing well—and make it
    feel effortless. No flashy features, no clutter.
</p>

<h2>Simplicity over Flash</h2>
<p>
    We don't chase trends or build for "wow." We build for longevity. That means
    stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the essential—refining complexity
    into elegance and meaning.
</p>

<h2>Standards First, but Roll When Needed</h2>
<p>
    We favor open standards for interoperability and resilience. But we're not
    afraid to build from scratch when standards fall short or third-party
    libraries add too much bloat. We prefer understanding every byte we ship.
</p>

<h2>Human-Centered Systems</h2>
<p>
    Sector F Labs puts people first: designing tools that respect your privacy,
    respond to your context, and feel natural to use. We imagine a future where
    software supports, listens, and learns.
</p>

<h2>Software That Belongs to You</h2>
<p>
    Your software should adapt to your workflow, your pace, your needs. At
    Sector F Labs, we believe technology should feel like it belongs to
    you—because it does.
</p>

<h2>Anti-DRY (When It Matters)</h2>
<p>
    Overusing "Don't Repeat Yourself" can lead to fragile, overly abstracted
    code. We're okay with a little duplication if it means clarity, autonomy,
    and flexibility. Good abstractions should earn their keep, emerging
    naturally, not imposed prematurely.
