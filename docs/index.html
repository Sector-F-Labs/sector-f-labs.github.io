    <h1>Welcome to Sector F Labs</h1>
<p>
  Sector F Labs is a place for trying out ideas and building simple, useful tools. We like to experiment, break out of old habits, and make things that are powerful and actually nice to use. 
  Sometimes that means a new tool for a specific need, sometimes a knowledge base,
  or even just an experiment to test an idea. We craft software tailored to each problem,
  rather than forcing existing solutions where they don't naturally fit.

<h3>🛠 Engineering with Intention</h3>
<p>
  We believe the best tools are the ones that disappear—the ones that do their job without calling attention to themselves. Every design decision should serve a clear purpose. No flashy features, no noise. Just clean, focused systems that do one thing well—and make that thing feel effortless.
</p>
<h3>📐 Simplicity over Flash</h3>
<p>
  We don’t chase trends. We don’t build for “wow.” We build for longevity. That means stripping away what’s unnecessary and getting to the essence of a tool. Simplicity isn’t the absence of complexity—it’s the result of deeply understanding it and distilling it into something usable, beautiful, and meaningful.
</p>
<h3>🧱 Standards First, but Roll When Needed</h3>
<p>
  We favor open standards because they promote interoperability, transparency, and resilience. But when standards become burdensome or when third-party libraries compromise performance or clarity, we build from scratch. We’d rather own every byte of what we ship than blindly trust an abstraction we didn’t author and can’t easily fix.
</p>
<h3>👤 Human-Centered Systems</h3>
<p>
  Sector F Labs puts people first—always. That means designing tools that respect your privacy, adapt to your context, and feel natural to use. We imagine a future where software doesn’t interrupt, track, or overwhelm—but instead supports, listens, and learns.
</p>
<h3>📖 Software That Belongs to You</h3>
<p>
  The relationship between a person and their software should feel like partnership, not ownership. You shouldn’t have to fight your tools. They should fit around your workflow, your needs, your pace. At Sector F Labs, we believe technology should feel like it belongs to you—because it does.
</p>
<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  We try to build things with care—choosing simplicity over bells and whistles, and depth over flashiness.<br>
  We’d rather use open standards than invent our own, but if we have to pick between rolling our own and pulling in a big third-party library, we’ll usually just write it ourselves.<br>
  At the end of the day, we think software should fit you, not the other way around.
</p>
<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>
  Sector F Labs isn’t just a lab—it’s a philosophy. A declaration that software can be better. That minimal can be powerful. That privacy isn’t a feature—it’s a foundation. And that thoughtful engineering can create something more than functional: something humane.
</p>
<p>
  If that resonates with you, then welcome. You’re one of us.
