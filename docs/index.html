        <h1>Sector F Labs: Thoughtful Software for a Human Future</h1>
    <p>
      Sector F Labs is a personal workshop dedicated to building purposeful, privacy-first software. We believe in creating tools that adapt to you, prioritizing simplicity, thoughtful engineering, and a user-respectful design.

  <section id="engineering-with-intention">
    <h2>🛠 Engineering with Intention</h2>
    <p>
      We believe the best tools quietly do their job. Every design decision should serve a clear purpose: focused systems that do one thing well—and make it feel effortless.  No flashy features, no clutter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="simplicity-over-flash">
    <h2>📐 Simplicity over Flash</h2>
    <p>
      We don't chase trends or build for "wow." We build for longevity. That means stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the essential—refining complexity into elegance and meaning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="standards-when-sensible">
    <h2>🧱 Standards First, but Roll When Needed</h2>
    <p>
      We favor open standards for interoperability and resilience. But we're not afraid to build from scratch when standards fall short or third-party libraries add too much bloat. We prefer understanding every byte we ship.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="human-centered">
    <h2>👤 Human-Centered Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Sector F Labs puts people first: designing tools that respect your privacy, respond to your context, and feel natural to use. We imagine a future where software supports, listens, and learns.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="ownership">
    <h2>📖 Software That Belongs to You</h2>
    <p>
      Your software should adapt to your workflow, your pace, your needs. At Sector F Labs, we believe technology should feel like it belongs to you—because it does.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="anti-dry" class="callout">
    <h2>🙅‍♂️ Anti-DRY (When It Matters)</h2>
    <p>
      Overusing "Don’t Repeat Yourself" can lead to fragile, overly abstracted code.  We’re okay with a little duplication if it means clarity, autonomy, and flexibility. Good abstractions should earn their keep, emerging naturally, not imposed prematurely.
