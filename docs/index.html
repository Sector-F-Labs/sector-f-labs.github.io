    <h1>Welcome to Sector F Labs</h1>
<p>
  Sector F Labs is a space for trying out ideas and building simple, useful tools. We like to experiment, break old habits, and make things that are powerful—yet actually pleasant to use.
  Sometimes that means a new tool for a specific need. Sometimes, a knowledge base. Sometimes, just an experiment to test a thought. We craft software that fits the problem, instead of forcing off-the-shelf solutions where they don’t belong.
</p>

<h3>🛠 Engineering with Intention</h3>
<p>
  We believe the best tools are the ones that disappear—the ones that quietly do their job without calling attention to themselves. Every design decision should serve a clear purpose. No flashy features. No clutter. Just focused systems that do one thing well—and make it feel effortless.
</p>

<h3>📐 Simplicity over Flash</h3>
<p>
  We don’t chase trends. We don’t build for “wow.” We build for longevity. That means stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the essential. Simplicity isn’t the absence of complexity—it’s the reward for understanding it deeply, and refining it into something elegant and meaningful.
</p>

<h3>🧱 Standards First, but Roll When Needed</h3>
<p>
  We favor open standards. They promote interoperability, clarity, and resilience. But when standards fall short—or when third-party libraries bring more bloat than benefit—we’re not afraid to build from scratch. We’d rather understand every byte we ship than rely on abstractions we can’t control.
</p>

<h3>👤 Human-Centered Systems</h3>
<p>
  Sector F Labs puts people first. That means designing tools that respect your privacy, respond to your context, and feel natural to use. We imagine a future where software doesn’t interrupt, track, or overload—but instead supports, listens, and learns.
</p>

<h3>📖 Software That Belongs to You</h3>
<p>
  Your relationship with software should feel like a partnership—not a power struggle. You shouldn’t have to wrestle with your tools. They should adapt to your workflow, your pace, your needs. At Sector F Labs, we believe technology should feel like it belongs to you—because it does.
</p>

<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  We try to build with care—choosing simplicity over bells and whistles, and depth over flash.<br>
  We’d rather follow open standards than invent our own—but if the choice is between rolling our own or importing a heavy third-party library, we’ll usually write it ourselves.<br>
  In the end, we believe software should adapt to you, not the other way around.
</p>

<h2>How We Build</h2>
<h3>🙅‍♂️ Anti-DRY (When It Matters)</h3>
<p>
  DRY—“Don’t Repeat Yourself”—sounds wise, but overusing it can lead to fragile, overly abstracted code. We’ve seen the results: one abstraction meant to serve three different problems ends up fully solving none. It’s like putting wagon wheels on a car, a Formula One racer, and an airplane—because, well, they all need wheels, right?
</p>
<p>
  At Sector F Labs, we’re okay with a little duplication if it means clarity, autonomy, and flexibility. We prefer repeating something clean over sharing something brittle. Good abstractions should earn their keep—they should emerge naturally, not be imposed prematurely.
</p>
<p>
  Repetition has a cost. But misapplied abstractions accrue technical debt—with interest.
</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>
  Sector F Labs isn’t just a lab—it’s a philosophy. A quiet declaration that software can be better. That minimal can still be powerful. That privacy isn’t a feature—it’s the foundation. And that thoughtful engineering can lead to something more than just usable: something humane.
</p>
<p>
  If that resonates with you, then you will probably love our software as much as we do.
